# heyyyyyy 👋

I’m Vineet, a Computer Science student focused on building practical systems using
Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I use this space to experiment, learn, and
document projects that apply AI techniques to real-world datasets.

Most of my work revolves around data understanding, model design, and evaluation
rather than just model training.



## What I’m working on
- Machine learning pipelines with structured and unstructured data  
- Deep learning models for classification and detection tasks  
- Exploratory data analysis and feature engineering  
- Applying AI concepts to domains like healthcare, aviation, and space science  



## Tools & Technologies
- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript  
- **ML / DL:** scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras  
- **Data:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Cloud (learning):** AWS fundamentals, model deployment basics  



## Projects
You’ll find projects here covering:
- Medical image analysis using convolutional neural networks  
- Anomaly detection on real-world datasets  
- Classification problems with careful data exploration and validation  

Each repository includes clear documentation, reproducible workflows, and
explanations of design choices.



## How I approach projects
- Start with understanding the data, not the model  
- Use EDA to guide feature engineering and assumptions  
- Prefer simple, interpretable baselines before complex models  
- Evaluate models using appropriate metrics, not just accuracy  



## Currently learning
- Advanced deep learning concepts  
- Cloud-aware ML workflows  
- Writing cleaner, more maintainable ML code
